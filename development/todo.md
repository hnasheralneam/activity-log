// Recommend commonly used tasks based on time and location
// Filter through suggestions as you type
// Group tasks by catogory (custom color, used for charts)
// Add settings to export
// Rename tasks
// Days since activity should be calculated before adding to array item, by subtracting .01, multiplied by 1.1 for each consecutive week distant
// Show graph for when tasks were done

/*
== Things that are broken ==
// Multiple tabs mess with save

== Settings ==
// Setting to continue tasks when tab is closed

== Visual ==
// Task color is black on first added tasks
// Dark theme

== Automate activites ==
Automated activites will have a set schedule time, which can be repeated, when it will alert you, and you can choose to start/delay/ignore the activity (call reminders?)

- create easy way to add time later (set start finish times, length)
- save open page
- missing replay button with short collapse, this is because it apparently runs the short collapse twice? will need to fix soon


- chart needs colors
